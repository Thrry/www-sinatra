    why: Why Le Wagon?
    rationale: |
      <p>Everybody can learn to code using online tutorials.
      Only it’s long and painful: you stumble and grope along,
      you spend hours and hours with stack overflow when all
      you want to do is code on your current projects..</p>
      <p>Our program will immediately sink you into a super
      stimulant ecosystem where you’ll learn 10 times faster.
      Moreover, you will will learn what can not be taught on line:
      a dev’s set-up, web development best practice, software architecture
      and data base modelling. To sum up, you’ll learn to go from a
      concrete problem to a technical solution.</p>
    join_the_community: Join the community
    le_wagon_community: |
      <p>At the end of our program you’ll know how to transform
      your ideas into products, you will have coded several web
      apps and you’ll have a  work portofolio on Github.</p>
      <p>You’ll be part of a hypercative community: 80 alumnis,
      8 teachers, 12 mentors, 7 start-ups created by alumnis, Masterclasses
      every Thursday with successful entrepreneurs and CEOs who will network
      with you, technical coaching for your projects post-program.</p>
      <p>Developers, entrepreneurs, incubators or accelerators,
      you will join a passionate and helpful community who will
      bring you many opportunities.</p>
    the_spirit: The Spirit
    le_wagon_spirit: |
      <p>All Le Wagon’s teachers are web entrepreneurs (Taster’s Clubn Sylights, Txto etc)
      already having a “ground experience” of programing thus knowing
      the key-concepts to emphasize during classes.</p>
      <p>Every participant is also coached by a mentor, a professional
      developer who will follow your projects and make sure
      everything is up to date.</p>
