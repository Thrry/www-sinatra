Ancien élève du [Devbootcamp](http://www.devbootcamp.com/), Mack vit en France depuis 1 an. Après avoir travaillé chez  [Tigerlily](http://www.tigerlilyapps.com/fr/), il a décidé de se concentrer sur son service d'abonnement/partage autour du whiskey [Taster's Club](http://www.tastersclub.com/) et de rejoindre l'équipe du wagon pour enseigner **le code qui sert**. Il nous parle de son expérience à DBC et de son rôle au wagon, forgive the english !

#### What did you learn during DBC that helped you find a job?

What was great about Dev Bootcamp is that they not only taught the fundamentals of Ruby/Rails (the essentials to getting a Rails gig), but the more intangible parts of what it means to be a good developer - taking and giving feedback on your work, how to be that guy people want to work with, how to bring a fresh perspective to a project. They taught me that being a good developer means a lot more than writing good code - there's such a human element to the whole thing that people sometimes ignore. I still have a lot of work to do on both sides of that equation, but I'm really thankful that they encouraged me to have that holistic perspective.


#### What did you do after the DBC?

I moved to Paris the better part of a year ago. For most of that time, I was working for a startup as a rails developer but more recently started focusing full-time on [Taster's Club](http://www.tastersclub.com), a whiskey "learning/drinking club" that I've been running out of the US for the last year. Coming soon to France...

#### What do you do know? Do you use what you learn at DBC on a daily basis?

Yes, I use this stuff all the time. If you have a business online that you want to optimize, it can require a good deal of maintenance, especially in the beginning.

When I started [TC](http://www.tastersclub.com/), I had a spreadsheet that I would use to manage customers. Everything administrative would happen in excel - recording how many bottles everyone received, cancellations, renewals, upgrade, shipping history, etc… It got pretty unwieldy as my membership grew - I knew it wasn't the best solution.

Now we have an web app to handle all the administration of our members' subscriptions, generate email communication to members, receipts, create and send out our PDF welcome certificate, etc… We use Stripe to process our subscription payments. Our blog is powered by Jekyll. It's all sitting on Heroku. It's much easier and takes way less time. It was obvious that something like this is the best solution but it wasn't until I learned to code that I could actually make it happen.

#### What will be your role for le wagon's 1st class program? What do you want to teach students?

I want to encourage the students to have a goal in mind when they are learning to code.

When I learned to code, the moments where I was learning just for the sake of learning weren't always super productive. On the other hand, when I could relate what I was learning to something I was trying to build, every lesson meant so much more. I was more curious, too - I couldn't stop asking questions. If a student can get fired up about making something in particular, they're going to learn to get there faster and with a purpose.
