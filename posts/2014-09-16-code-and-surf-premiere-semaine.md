title:  "Le Wagon Surfcamp | first week"
---

Coding, surfing, indian summer... For about a week, the 16 participants of Le Wagon Surfcamp are experiencing the Calfornian way of life. And the forcasts look good. 7 more days full of waves and intense coding sessions are planned.

Hidden in the middle of wood near Soustons, the little tribe is doing well. Cheking the swell between two lines of code, they all catched up the surfing vibes and won't return to their civil live undammaged. Who never dreamed of masterized the arcanes of Ruby and Rails under the sun waiting for the low tide?
